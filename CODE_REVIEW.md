## ❌ MISSING FEATURES (MVP Requirements)

### 🚨 CRITICAL - Public API for Portfolio Integration

According to `feature.md`, the original requirement was:
> "d'exposer les posts via une API Next.js pour qu'un portfolio puisse les récupérer"  
> (Expose posts via a Next.js API for a portfolio to retrieve them)

**Status:** ❌ **NOT IMPLEMENTED**

This is the PRIMARY BLOCKER for completing the MVP. The portfolio application cannot fetch content without a public API.

#### **Missing Endpoints:**
```
GET  /api/posts                    → List published posts (with pagination)
GET  /api/posts/[slug]             → Get single post with content
GET  /api/posts/search?q=query      → Search posts by title/content
GET  /api/feed                      → RSS or JSON feed
GET  /api/images                    → List public/published images
GET  /api/tags                      → List all tags
```

#### **Required API Features:**
- Pagination support (limit, offset)
- Filtering by:
  - Publication status (published only for public API)
  - Tags
  - Date range
  - Author
- Sorting options:
  - By created date (default)
  - By published date
  - By updated date
- Response formatting:
  - JSON with proper structure
  - Content as markdown or HTML
  - Metadata included
- CORS headers for cross-origin access
- Rate limiting
- Proper HTTP status codes

---

### Other Missing Features

#### **Search & Filtering** ❌
- ❌ Post search functionality (UI exists but logic missing)
- ❌ Post filtering by status/tags
- ❌ Image search in media library
- ❌ Image filtering by type/date
- ❌ Filter button in posts list is non-functional

#### **Settings & Configuration** ⚠️

**Current State:** Settings page exists but is **READ-ONLY**
- ⚠️ Shows GitHub configuration fields
- ⚠️ Displays default values
- ❌ No form submission handler
- ❌ Changes are NOT persisted
- ❌ Cannot update repository
- ❌ Cannot update branch
- ❌ Cannot update authentication token

**Impact:** Users cannot change their GitHub settings or repository configuration.

#### **Content Management** ❌
- ❌ Advanced tag management UI
- ❌ Batch operations on posts (bulk delete, bulk publish)
- ❌ Post duplication/templates
- ❌ Revision history viewing
- ❌ Change comparison (diff view)
- ✅ Post status tracking (draft, published)

#### **User Experience** ⚠️
- ❌ No authentication/login system
  - No user management
  - No per-user permissions
  - Assumes single-user setup
  - GitHub token stored in .env only
- ❌ No dark/light theme toggle
- ❌ No email notifications
- ❌ No draft preview URL (cannot share draft with others)
- ❌ No slug uniqueness validation (only on save)
- ❌ No unsaved changes warning
- ❌ No browser back button handling

#### **Advanced Features** ❌
- ❌ Image optimization/resizing
- ❌ Image cropping tool
- ❌ CDN integration
- ❌ SEO metadata editor (keywords, canonical URL)
- ❌ Auto-save drafts to localStorage
- ❌ Comments/discussion system
- ❌ Post analytics and views
- ❌ Webhook triggers on post publish
- ❌ GraphQL API option
- ❌ Export functionality (PDF, DOCX)
- ❌ Import from other platforms

---

## 🚨 CRITICAL ISSUES

### 1. Settings Page is Non-Functional

**Location:** `app/cms/settings/page.tsx`

**Problem:**
```tsx
<Input
  id="owner"
  placeholder="username"
  defaultValue="victor3spoir"  // ← Shows default value
  // ← No onChange handler
  // ← No form submission
  // ← Changes are NOT saved
/>
```

**Impact:** 
- Users cannot modify GitHub repository settings
- Cannot change branch
- Cannot update authentication token
- No way to switch repositories

**Solution Required:**
```tsx
// Add form submission handler
// Add state management for settings
// Persist to environment or database
// Add validation and error handling
```

### 2. Missing Public API Endpoints

**Severity:** CRITICAL for MVP

**Current State:** No `/api/*` routes exist

**Impact:** 
- Portfolio cannot fetch posts
- No way to display content publicly
- Cannot create blog listing page

**Required Implementation:**
```
/api/posts
/api/posts/[slug]
/api/images
/api/feed
```

### 3. Search is Non-Functional

**Location:** `app/cms/articles/page.tsx`

**Problem:**
```tsx
<IconSearch className="absolute left-3 top-1/2 size-4 -translate-y-1/2 text-muted-foreground" />
<Input placeholder="Search posts..." className="pl-9" />
// ← No onChange handler
// ← No filtering logic
// ← Filter button also non-functional
```

**Impact:** Users cannot search their posts

## 📊 MVP READINESS ASSESSMENT

### Overall Score: **65-70% Ready**

#### ✅ What Works Well:
1. Post creation & editing with MDX support
2. Image management with proper validation
3. GitHub integration for content storage
4. Dashboard with real-time statistics
5. Modern, responsive UI with good UX
6. Server-side validation with Zod
7. Publish/unpublish workflow
8. Recent activity tracking
9. Metadata management with dates
10. Proper error handling and notifications

#### ❌ What's Missing for MVP:
1. **Public API** - CRITICAL (blocks portfolio integration)
2. **Search functionality** - Important for usability
3. **Working settings** - Currently read-only
4. **Authentication** - No user management
5. **Draft preview** - Cannot share drafts

#### ⚠️ What's Partially Done:
1. Settings page UI (exists but non-functional)
2. Filter button (exists but no logic)

## ✨ CONCLUSION

**MDVault is approximately 65-70% ready for MVP launch.**

### Summary
The core CMS functionality is **well-implemented and production-ready**, with clean code, proper validations, and good UX. However, the **public API for portfolio integration is completely missing**, which was one of the primary stated requirements in `feature.md`.

### Current State
- ✅ Excellent CMS for managing blog posts
- ✅ Good dashboard and statistics
- ✅ Modern, responsive UI
- ❌ Cannot be used publicly without API
- ⚠️ Settings page needs fixing
- ⚠️ Search feature incomplete

### Recommendation

**To reach MVP status and launch, you MUST:**

1. **Implement public API endpoints** (Priority 🔴 CRITICAL)
   - `/api/posts` - list published posts
   - `/api/posts/[slug]` - get single post
   - Add pagination and filtering

2. **Fix settings page** (Priority 🟠 HIGH)
   - Make it actually save changes
   - Add form validation

3. **Complete search** (Priority 🟠 HIGH)
   - Wire up the existing UI
   - Add filtering logic

**Estimated effort:** 3-5 days of development

**After these three items, MDVault will be a complete MVP ready for public launch.**
