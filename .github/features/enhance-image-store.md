# Features: create image like store

using folder (/contents/images) in the remote repo:

>notice here structure, code & components already exists for media handling

- create store like for image (uploaded image should be save under /content/images)

- uploaded image are renamed uuid/token like while keeping thier .ext

- only upload image can be used in post edition (cover image & in post image)

- update image selector to instruct user to select image from the image store.

- i've noticed when change heading style in post editor, changes are not display visualy (text shown as heading of assigned level): fix it
